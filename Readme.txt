/map2 - teleport to copy of map GTA-SA

Copy of GTA-SA contains the main objects of the ENTIRE map
GTA-SA. To reduce the load on objects
, 80-90 percent of trees
(including 
palm trees), pillars, and flower beds are missing
on the copy of the map. The map contains:

1. roads, hills, mountains, etc. - 100 %
2. houses 90-95 %
3. bottom soil of all reservoirs - 100 %

Some houses (buildings) and garages may lack
doors (gates).
Coordinates of a copy of the GTA-SA map :

for X - from -3000 to 3000

for Y - from -10000 to -4000

To transfer a copy of the map (or a separate part of the map copy)

to any other place, it is convenient to use 
the "object group editor" script
from site https://gnr-samp.ucoz.ru/:
